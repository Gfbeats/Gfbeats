# INSIGHT AND FINDINGS
Analyzing the export performance of the given countries, Vietnam stands out with an export index of 72, indicating a highly developed and diversified export sector, likely bolstered by its strong manufacturing base and integration into global supply chains. Vanuatu, with an index of 47, shows a significant but more modest export capability, potentially driven by niche markets such as agriculture and tourism-related products. Zambia, with an index of 37, likely benefits from its mining industry, particularly copper. Yemen, with an index of 30, reflects its reliance on oil exports despite ongoing conflict and instability affecting its economic performance. Venezuela, with the lowest index of 29, underscores the severe impact of political and economic turmoil on its export capacity, heavily reliant on its struggling oil sector. These figures illustrate the varied economic landscapes and export efficiencies of these nations

# INSIGHT AND FINDINGS
Analyzing the income data alongside the export indices provides a nuanced view of these countries' economic dynamics. Despite having the highest export index of 72, Vietnam's income is $4.5k, indicating efficient export operations but possibly lower value-added goods. Venezuela, with the highest income of $15.5k, despite a low export index of 29, suggests that its primary export, oil, commands high prices, although this sector is fraught with instability. Yemen, matching Vietnam's income at $4.5k but with a lower export index of 30, reflects a reliance on higher-value exports despite internal challenges. Zambia, with an income of $3.3k and an export index of 37, shows that its mining exports are significant but perhaps not diversified. Vanuatu, with the lowest income of $3.0k and an export index of 47, indicates a small economy with niche export sectors that may not generate high income. These insights reveal that a high export index does not always correlate with higher income, emphasizing the importance of the type and value of exports

# INSIGHT AND FINDINGS
Vietnam leads with a substantial import value of 80, indicating a robust trade environment likely driven by its integration into global supply chains, particularly in electronics and textiles. Vanuatu, with an import value of 53, showcases a relatively high level for a small island nation, suggesting a heavy reliance on imports for goods and services. Yemen (34) and Zambia (31) have moderate import levels, which may reflect economic challenges or limited industrial capacity, impacting their ability to engage in substantial trade. Venezuela, with the lowest import value of 18, highlights the severe economic crisis and international sanctions affecting its ability to participate in global markets. This data underscores the diverse economic landscapes and the varying degrees of dependency on international trade among these countries.

# * Which country has the highest child mortality rate

# INSIGHT AND FINDINGS
The child mortality rates in the listed countries reveal significant disparities, reflecting varying levels of healthcare quality, economic stability, and social infrastructure. Zambia has the highest rate at 83 deaths per 1,000 live births, indicating severe challenges in healthcare access and maternal-child health services. Yemen follows with a rate of 56, likely exacerbated by ongoing conflict and humanitarian crises. Vanuatu, with a rate of 29, shows moderate child mortality, possibly due to limited healthcare resources typical in small island developing states. Vietnam, with a rate of 23, and Venezuela, with the lowest rate of 17, highlight better healthcare systems and relatively more stable social conditions, although Venezuela's ongoing economic crisis could pose future risks. These statistics underscore the critical need for targeted interventions to address child health disparities, especially in high-risk regions like Zambia and Yemen

# * What are the first top three countries with highest GDPP

![Screenshot (125)](https://github.com/Gfbeats/Gfbeats/assets/159473659/6a8b25fb-401e-4e9f-9ce5-8c5e84140f16)

# INSIGHT AND FINDINGS
The Gross Domestic Product per capita (GDP per capita) figures for Zambia, Vietnam, and Yemen—1460, 1310, and 1310 respectively—provide a nuanced perspective on the economic conditions underlying child mortality rates. Despite Zambia having the highest GDP per capita among the three, it also exhibits the highest child mortality rate at 83 per 1,000 live births. This suggests that economic output alone does not necessarily translate into better health outcomes, potentially due to inequitable distribution of wealth or inefficient healthcare systems. Vietnam and Yemen, with identical GDP per capita, show markedly different child mortality rates of 23 and 56 respectively. Vietnam's relatively low child mortality rate indicates effective utilization of economic resources towards healthcare and social services, whereas Yemen's higher mortality rate likely reflects the detrimental impacts of conflict and instability. These insights highlight the complex interplay between economic capacity and health outcomes, underscoring the importance of not only economic growth but also effective governance and targeted health interventions
# * Which first five countries has the highest maximum life expectation

# INSIGHT AND FINDINGS
Venezuela leads with a maximum life expectancy of 75 years, followed closely by Vietnam at 73 years. Yemen shows a slight drop with a life expectancy of 68 years, while Vanuatu and Zambia have significantly lower figures at 63 and 52 years, respectively. These differences can be attributed to various factors, including healthcare quality, economic stability, social conditions, and access to essential services. The relatively higher life expectancy in Venezuela and Vietnam may reflect better healthcare systems and higher standards of living compared to the lower life expectancy in Vanuatu and Zambia, which may face more significant economic and healthcare challenges. This data underscores the critical role of socio-economic factors in influencing life expectancy across different regions.

# * What country has the least health issues

![Screenshot (127)](https://github.com/Gfbeats/Gfbeats/assets/159473659/4c979f0b-95e1-4405-9487-85fe5ffa8fc7)

# INSIGHT AND FINDINGS
The least health expenditure per country highlights stark contrasts in healthcare investment. Afghanistan has the highest health expenditure among the listed countries at 7.6% of GDP, followed by Albania at 6.6%, and Antigua and Barbuda at 6.0%. In contrast, Algeria and Angola have considerably lower expenditures at 4.2% and 2.9%, respectively. These variations suggest differences in national priorities, economic capacity, and the overall state of healthcare infrastructure. Countries like Afghanistan and Albania, despite having higher health expenditures, may still face significant health challenges due to factors such as political instability and limited resources. On the other hand, the low expenditures in Algeria and Angola could indicate either a lack of resources allocated to healthcare or more efficient systems requiring less spending. This data emphasizes the importance of not only the amount spent on healthcare but also how effectively these funds are utilized to improve health outcomes.

# CONCLUSION
The comprehensive analysis of various socio-economic and health indicators across multiple countries reveals significant disparities in health outcomes, economic performance, and social conditions. The data illustrates how different factors such as GDP per capita, export and import indices, health expenditure, and child mortality rates interplay to influence life expectancy and overall well-being. High export and import values, as seen in Vietnam, correlate with robust economic activity but do not always translate into higher income or better health outcomes. Similarly, higher health expenditures, as seen in Afghanistan and Albania, do not necessarily guarantee better health metrics due to underlying political and resource-based challenges.

Countries like Venezuela and Vietnam show relatively higher life expectancy, reflecting better healthcare systems and social conditions, while nations like Zambia and Yemen face severe health challenges despite varied economic performances. The data underscores the complexity of ensuring equitable health outcomes and the need for effective governance and resource allocation.

# RECOMMENDATION 
Targeted Health Interventions: Countries with high child mortality rates, such as Zambia and Yemen, require urgent healthcare interventions focusing on maternal and child health services to reduce mortality rates and improve overall health outcomes.

Economic Diversification: Nations overly reliant on a single sector, like Venezuela with oil, should diversify their economies to mitigate risks associated with market fluctuations and political instability, enhancing economic resilience.

Efficient Utilization of Health Expenditure: Countries with higher health expenditures should focus on improving the efficiency and effectiveness of their healthcare systems to ensure better health outcomes, as seen in Afghanistan and Albania.

Strengthening Healthcare Infrastructure: Countries with lower life expectancy and high child mortality rates need to invest in healthcare infrastructure, ensuring equitable access to essential health services for all citizens.

Promoting Stable Governance: Political stability is crucial for economic development and health improvements. Countries facing instability should prioritize establishing stable governance frameworks to create conducive environments for growth and development.

Enhanced Global Cooperation: International organizations and developed nations should support economically challenged countries through financial aid, technical assistance, and capacity-building initiatives to improve their health systems and economic stability.

By addressing these recommendations, countries can work towards achieving more equitable health outcomes and sustainable economic development, improving the quality of life for their populations.
