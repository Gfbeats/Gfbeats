For a contry to move forward and beat economic meltdown,Its economic activities must be on constant review,This project main aim was to understand and assertain which country has the highest and the lowest Import,export,Birth rate,mortality rate,Income etc.

The following Inquires,Provided us with better understanding
* How many Countries are involved in this project
* What is ther gross total income of all countries involved 
* What is the total GDPP of all countries
* What is the Maximum export of all contries
* Which top fisrt five countries has the highest export
* Which top first five countries has the highest income
* Which top five countries has the highest import
* Which country has the highest child mortality rate
* What are the first top three countries with highest GDPP
* Which first five countries has the highest maximum life expectation
* What country has the least health issues

# DATA COLLECTION 
This dataset was gotten from Kaggle.com,and has just a table in an xlsx format Which has the following column imbedded on it as follows
* Country,Child Mort,Expory,Health,Import,Incomre,Inflation,Life expectancy,Total fertility,GDPP

# TOOL USED
In this prtoject,i made use of POWER BI for data Visualisation

# DATA PREPARATION
The following steps were done in order to get the data ready for analysis.

• To import the xlsx dataset, PowerBi was utilized.

• I performed an ETL procedure and used Power Query Editor to transform the data before loading it for analysis and visualization.

• I began the process of cleaning the data by first performing an EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) checking for duplicate values, but none were discovered.

• I checked my table to make sure there were no null found.

• In addition, I made sure that each column was represented by the proper data type.

  # INSIGHT AND FINDINGS
  With 167 number of countries involed,we can say that 98% of the total number of contries around the world is properly covered for this analysis

 # INSIGHT AND FINDINGS
 With over 2.86 million dollars as the total gross profit,its shows that to an extent,the world is doing impressively with their economic activities such as import and export as this also increases GDPP.
 
* What is the total GDPP of all countries

  # INSIGHT AND FINDINGS
  In comparism with the total income,we can say the GDPP is absolutly on the high side which is good for every country's economy'

* What is the Maximum export of all contries

# INSIGHT AND FINDINGS
The maximum export for all country happens to be 200.00,as we aforetime understand that asia countries have more productivities of economic priducts to either manufacture or export 

* Which top five countries has the highest export

# INSIGHT AND FINDINGS

Analyzing the export performance of the given countries, Vietnam stands out with an export index of 72, indicating a highly developed and diversified export sector, likely bolstered by its strong manufacturing base and integration into global supply chains. Vanuatu, with an index of 47, shows a significant but more modest export capability, potentially driven by niche markets such as agriculture and tourism-related products. Zambia, with an index of 37, likely benefits from its mining industry, particularly copper. Yemen, with an index of 30, reflects its reliance on oil exports despite ongoing conflict and instability affecting its economic performance. Venezuela, with the lowest index of 29, underscores the severe impact of political and economic turmoil on its export capacity, heavily reliant on its struggling oil sector. These figures illustrate the varied economic landscapes and export efficiencies of these nations

* Which top first five countries has the highest income

# INSIGHT AND FINDINGS
Analyzing the income data alongside the export indices provides a nuanced view of these countries' economic dynamics. Despite having the highest export index of 72, Vietnam's income is $4.5k, indicating efficient export operations but possibly lower value-added goods. Venezuela, with the highest income of $15.5k, despite a low export index of 29, suggests that its primary export, oil, commands high prices, although this sector is fraught with instability. Yemen, matching Vietnam's income at $4.5k but with a lower export index of 30, reflects a reliance on higher-value exports despite internal challenges. Zambia, with an income of $3.3k and an export index of 37, shows that its mining exports are significant but perhaps not diversified. Vanuatu, with the lowest income of $3.0k and an export index of 47, indicates a small economy with niche export sectors that may not generate high income. These insights reveal that a high export index does not always correlate with higher income, emphasizing the importance of the type and value of exports
